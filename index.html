        <h1>Jenny Hoelzer</h1>
        <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
            <p>I attended Eleven Fifty Academy's 12-week JavaScript bootcamp in the summer of 2017. Through Eleven Fifty and Employ Up, I was contracted to build a new website for Dove Recovery House for Women. I worked in a small team to create a responsive website from scratch using designs from a local graphic designer who was working with Dove Recovery House.</p>
        <h2>Previous Education</h2>
            <p>Before I got into coding, I graduated from Carroll University in Waukesha, Wisconsin, with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science. I also minored in both Graphic Design and Art.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy video games, books, movies, and TV. I also spend a lot of time on art projects in various mediums (clay, pencils, photography, etc.) I have also gotten into digital art, both 2D and 3D.</p>
